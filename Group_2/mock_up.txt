      manage and update a document layout
      and its content
      - A Texteditor
      - An Operatingsystem
      - Young people slang for latin

  2. How is a LaTeX File structured?
      - True: Preamble + Textfile
      - It is not, Entropy consumes all
      - Header, Body and Footer
      - Each Sentence has it's own File

      Hints: 
      - Head and Body, Knees and Toes are not relevant to LaTeX
      - Everything in Reality strifes for Entropy. The digital world is not Reality tho.
      - Files per Sentece is a bit much, isn't it?
      - Just like your Language Teachers, Preamble + Main Content is the way to go.

  3. Write an equation that looks like this : $\Sigma_{i=1}^n x_i + 2$

      Hints:
      - What ways do you know to write an equation in latex? Which one would be the most simple one?
      - Mathematics relays on variables like x, y and z. What other language and its letters can be found in mathematics?
      - If certain words serve as keywords to do something, like render a greek latter, than you couldn't write that keyword into a text anymore, could you? Does LaTeX have a way to deal with that?
      - You can put thing below or above other things by using _ and ^ respectivly
      - Sometimes you want to group things together to effect them all together. How does Mathematics notate things in a group?
      - Here is the answer $\Sigam_{i=1}^n x_i + 2$

  4. Suppose you a diagram you want to include into your work. It is stored as diagram1.pdf in the same folder as your .tex file. Write the LaTeX expression that would show the diagram

  A: \includegraphics{diagram1.pdf}

  Hints: 
  - There is no need to overcomplicate. You simply need to show the diagram, no special positioning needed.
  - Basicaly, the task is to include a graphic, isn't it? Are the naming of such functions\keywords arbitrary?
  - The solution does have the form \<Specific Keyword>{diagram1.pdf}
  - Including graphics can be suprisingly hard. Sometimes it would be nice if we simply could tell it to include graphics, right?
  - The solution is \includegraphics{diagram1.pdf}

  5. Which one of these examples is not correct LaTeX

    - $1 + 2 = 3$
    - $(\frac{1}{2})^2$
    - Suppose that x and y are Elements of Z\{0} (Answer)
    - The failure of patiance does not include the build up of anger \cite{Nerd1}

    Hints:
    - One may install additonal features into LaTeX. Thus unknown keywords may very well be valid. We woudn't ask such a mean question!
    - There is only one correct answer
    - Recall what you know about the keywords and characters with special meanings
    - If you wanted to print {} what would you have to do?
    - The answer is number 3. The } is not closed properly as \{ escapes and printes {.
